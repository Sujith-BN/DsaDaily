# DSADaily

**DSADaily** is my personal repository to practice **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** daily.  
It helps me track my learning, implement algorithms, and solve problems regularly.

## What's Inside

- **Problem Solutions:** Daily coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.
- **Data Structures:** Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, and more.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking, and other classic algorithms.
- **Notes & Explanations:** Short explanations, tips, and insights for better understanding.

## My Goal

- Strengthen problem-solving skills.
- Understand DSA concepts deeply.
- Maintain a daily coding habit.

## Language & Tools

- Languages: Java / C++ / Python
- Tools: VSCode / IntelliJ / GitHub
